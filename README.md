Hello there!!
Welcome to this repository. I made a program to encode and decode a string that is entered by the user. 
This is just for fun when you and your best friend are communicating in an encoded language in your class group!!!
<br />
### For example:
#### [encode]: 
what is the time?
<br />?hplw hkw vl wdkz
<br />
#### [decode]:
?hplw hkw vl wdkz
<br />what is the time?

## fused?
So I created [fused] that has both [encode] and [decode] classes **fused** together.
