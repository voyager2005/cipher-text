# random-programs

## Things that I want to work on:
### SimpleCalculator: 
- [x] make the calculator compute the power of two numbers
- [ ] make the program so that it can process blackets
- [ ] make the program so that it can process multiple oprators
- [ ] create a history section to the calculator


### encode and decode:
- [ ] add multiple layers of encoding to the string rather than only 1

###### hoping to complete the above during march - july 2021
